Diagnosis of Diabetic Maculopathy.
Abstract:

-For a particularly long time, automatic diagnosis of diabetic maculopathy from digital fundus images has been an active research topic in the medical image processing community. 
-Diabetic Maculopathy is human eye disease ,caused by uncontrolled chronic diabetes , which causes damage to retina of eye and it may eventually lead to complete blindness if not timely treated.
-Therefore detection of diabetic maculopathy in early stage is essential to avoid complete blindness. Regular screening for early disease detection has been a highly labour and resource intensive task
-Manual detection of diabetic maculopathy by ophthalmologist take plenty of time and patients need to suffer a lot at this time.
-In this study, an evaluation methodology is proposed and an image database with ground truth is described.
-This study proposes a machine learning cal coherence tomography method for extracting three features like exudates, hemorhages, and micro aneurysms and classification using hybrid classifier With the proposed database and protocol, it is possible to compare different algorithms, and correspondingly, analyse their maturity for technology transfer from the research laboratories to the medical.

Diabetes Mellitus:

-Diabetes mellitus is a group of diseases characterized by high blood glucose levels. Diabetes results from defects in the bodyâ€™s ability to produce and or use insulin.
-Type 1 diabetes  is usually diagnosed in children and young adults, and was previously known as  juvenile diabetes. In type 1 diabetes, the body does not produce insulin.5% of people with diabetes have this form of disease.
-In Type 2 diabetes  ,either the body does not produce enough insulin or the cells ignore the insulin. This is the most common form of diabetes.

Introduction:

-Diabetic maculopathy is the most common diabetic eye disease and a leading cause of blindness in adults. 
-Progressive dysfunction of the retinal blood vessels caused by chronic hyperglycemia is called Diabetic Maculopathy.
-It is caused by changes in the blood vessels of the retina. 
-In some people with diabetic maculopathy, blood vessels may swell and leak fluid. In other people, abnormal new blood vessels grow on the surface of the retina.
-The retina is the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. A healthy retina is necessary for good vision.
-If you have diabetic maculopathy, at first you may not notice changes to your vision. But over time, diabetic maculopathy can get worse and cause vision loss. 
-Diabetic maculopathy usually affects both eyes.
-It can be a complication of diabetes type 1 or diabetes type 2.
-Diabetes is one of the primary causes of causing blindness,almost 5% of the total cases in the world can be attributed to it.
-For a proper cure, a proper diagnosis is also necessary.
-Due to this major concern, we provide an automated system to robustly detect  diabetic maculopathy form the fundus images thereby providing a chance to save the vision of many people.

data set:
-The database consists of 89 colour fundus images of which 84 contain at least mild non-proliferative signs (Ma) of the diabetic maculopathy. 
-The images were taken in the Kuopio university hospital.
-The diabetic maculopathy abnormalities in the database are relatively small, but they appear near the macula which is considered to threaten the eyesight.

Conclusion:
-An image database, ground truth and evaluation methodology were proposed for evaluating and comparing methods for automatic detection of diabetic Maculopathy. 
-All data, a baseline method and evaluation functionality (tool kit) are available .
-The DIAERETDB1 provides a unified framework for benchmarking the methods. 
-The tool will provide accurate and reliable information of method performance to estimate their maturity before starting the technology transfer from the research laboratories to practice and industry.
